\item Consider the following snapshot of a system running in $n$ concurrent processes. Process $i$ is holding $X_i$ instances of a resource R, $1 \leq i \leq n$. Assume that all instances of R are currently in use. Further, for all $i$, process $i$ can place a request for at most $r_i$ additional instances of R while holding the $X_i$ instances it already has.

\item A certain processor deploys a single-level cache. The cache block size is 8 words and the word size is 4 bytes. The memory system uses a 60-MHz clock. To service a cache miss, the memory controller first takes 1 cycle to accept the starting address of the block, it then takes 3 cycles to fetch all the eight words of the block, and finally transmits the words of the requested block at the rate of 1 word per cycle. The maximum bandwidth for the memory system when the program running on the processor issues a series of read operations is $\underline{\quad\quad} \text{x} 10^6$ bytes/sec.
