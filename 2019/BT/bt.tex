	\item Yeast biomass (C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_3$N) grown on glucose is described by the stoichiometric equation given below: \\
		C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_6$ + 0.48 NH$_3$ + 3 O$_2$ $\rightarrow$ 0.48 C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_3$N + 3.12 CO$_2$ + 4.32 H$_2$O

		The amount of glucose needed for the production of 50 g L$^{-1}$ of yeast biomass in a batch reactor with a working volume of 1,00,000 L is \underline{\hspace{2cm}} kg (rounded off to the nearest integer).

	\item Phenolic wastewater discharged from an industry was treated with \textit{Pseudomonas} sp. in an aerobic bioreactor. The influent and effluent concentrations of phenol were 10,000 and 10 ppm, respectively. The inlet feed rate of wastewater was 80 L h$^{-1}$. The kinetic properties of the organism are as follows:

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Maximum specific growth rate ($\mu_m$) = 1 h$^{-1}$
			\item Saturation constant ($K_S$) = 100 mg L$^{-1}$
			\item Cell death rate ($k_d$) = 0.01 h$^{-1}$
		\end{itemize}

		Assuming that the bioreactor operates under â€˜chemostatâ€™ mode, the working volume required for this process is \underline{\hspace{2cm}} L (rounded off to the nearest integer).
	\item In a cross-flow filtration process, the pressure drop ($\Delta P$) driving the fluid flow is 2 atm, inlet feed pressure ($P_i$) is 3 atm and filtrate pressure ($P_f$) is equal to atmospheric pressure. The average transmembrane pressure drop ($\Delta P_m$) is \underline{\hspace{2cm}} atm.

	\item An industrial fermentor containing 10,000 L of medium needs to be sterilized. The initial spore concentration in the medium is $10^6$ spores mL$^{-1}$. The desired probability of contamination after sterilization is $10^{-3}$. The death rate of spores at 121 Â°C is 4 min$^{-1}$. Assume that there is no cell death during heating and cooling phases. The holding time of the sterilization process is \underline{\hspace{2cm}} min (rounded off to the nearest integer).

	\item The dimensions and operating condition of a lab-scale fermentor are as follows:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Volume = 1 L
			\item Diameter = 20 cm
			\item Agitator speed = 600 rpm
			\item Ratio of impeller diameter to fermentor diameter = 0.3
		\end{itemize}

		This fermentor needs to be scaled up to 8,000 L for a large-scale industrial application. If the scale-up is based on constant impeller tip speed, the speed of the agitator in the larger reactor is \underline{\hspace{2cm}} rpm. Assume that the scale-up factor is the cube root of the ratio of fermentor volumes.
