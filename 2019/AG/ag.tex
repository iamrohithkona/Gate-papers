		\item Directional derivative of $f(x,y,z) = xy^2 + yz^3$ at the point $(2, -1, 1)$ in the direction of vector $\hat{i} + 2\hat{j} + 2\hat{k}$ \textit{(rounded off to two decimal places)} is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item The mean absolute deviation about the median for the data 3, 9, 5, 3, 12, 10, 18, 4, 7, 19, 21 \textit{(rounded off to two decimal places)} is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item The application rate of an 18-nozzle hydraulic sprayer is 1120 L ha$^{-1}$. The nozzle spacing and forward speed are 400 mm and 3.4 km h$^{-1}$, respectively. The operating pressure is 2.1 MPa and the pump efficiency is 60\%. If 10\% of the pump output power is used for agitating the liquid, the power needed to operate the sprayer in kW \textit{(rounded off to three decimal places)} is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item A two-wheel drive tractor is taking a turn with a radius of curvature 5.0 m. The minimum horizontal distance between the tipping axis and line of action of the CG is 800 mm. The angle between the line of action of centrifugal force and perpendicular direction to the tipping plane is 15$^\circ$. If the vertical distance of the CG from the ground level is 900 mm, the limiting speed (in km h$^{-1}$) of the tractor to prevent overturning \textit{(rounded off to two decimal places)} is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item During operation, a two-wheel drive tractor with a total weight of 2000 kg has a weight distribution of 35\% and 65\% in front and rear axles, respectively. The width and diameter of the tyres fitted to the front axle are 0.18 m and 0.56 m, and those of the rear axle are 0.34 m and 1.10 m, respectively. If tyre deflection is 20\%, then rolling resistance (in kN) of the tractor in a soil with average cone index 1000 kPa at a wheel slip of 15\% \textit{(rounded off to two decimal places)} will be \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item The peak of a flood hydrograph due to a 5-hour storm is 670 m$^3$ s$^{-1}$. The total depth of rainfall is 9 cm. Assuming an average infiltration loss of 0.2 cm h$^{-1}$ and a constant baseflow of 30 m$^3$ s$^{-1}$, the peak discharge of the 5-hour unit hydrograph for this catchment in m$^3$ s$^{-1}$ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item A parabolic grassed water channel 8 m wide at the top and 60 cm deep is laid on a slope of 3\%. Assuming the value of ‘n’ in Manning’s formula as 0.04 m$^{-1/3}$ s, the discharge capacity (in m$^3$ s$^{-1}$) of the channel \textit{(rounded off to two decimal places)} is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item Undisturbed soil sample is collected from a field when the soil moisture is at field capacity. The inside diameter of the core sampler is 7.5 cm with a height of 15 cm. Weight of the core sampling cylinder with moist soil is 2.81 kg and that with oven dry soil is 2.61 kg. The weight of the core sampling cylinder is 1.56 kg. Assuming $\pi = 3.14$, the water depth in centimeter per meter depth of soil \textit{(rounded off to two decimal places)} is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item An irrigation stream of 27 L s$^{-1}$ is diverted to a check basin of size 12 m $\times$ 12 m. The water holding capacity of the soil is 15\% and the average soil moisture content in the crop root zone prior to applying water is 7.5\%. The depth of crop root zone is 1.2 m and apparent specific gravity of the soil is 1.5. Assuming no loss due to deep percolation, irrigation time (in minute) required to replenish the root zone moisture to its field capacity is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item Angle of internal friction of a certain grain (bulk density = 650 kg m$^{-3}$) is 30$^\circ$. A bin filled with this grain experiences a pressure of 60 kPa at its base. Ignoring the factor of safety, the safe height (in meter) to which water (density = 1000 kg m$^{-3}$) can be filled in this bin \textit{(rounded off to two decimal places)} is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item The steady-state mass transfer coefficient ($k_g$) based on water vapour pressure differential (VPD) operating across stagnant, non-diffusing air was estimated to be 0.05 g mole s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$ kPa$^{-1}$. If VPD varies from 12 kPa to 7 kPa over a distance of 2 mm, then the mass transfer coefficient ($k'_g$) based on equimolar counter-diffusion in g mole s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$ (mole fraction)$^{-1}$ \textit{(rounded off to one decimal place)} is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

		\item In an air blast freezing operation, a flat tray of 1.0 m$\times$1.0 m$\times$0.02 m dimensions is used to freeze filled depodded peas. Bulk density and moisture content of peas are 550 kg m$^{-3}$ and 85\% (w.b.), respectively. Latent heat of freezing from water to ice at -1$^\circ$C is 335 kJ kg$^{-1}$ and heat transfer occurs identically from the top and the bottom surfaces of the tray. Convective film heat transfer coefficient on the heat transfer surfaces of the tray is 30 W m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ and the thermal conductivity of frozen peas is 0.54 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. Assuming the tray to be a semi-infinite slab, the freezing time (in minutes) to completely freeze the product \textit{(rounded off to one decimal place)} is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.
