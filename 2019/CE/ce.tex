		The infiltration capacity at the start of this event ($t = 0$) is 17 mm/hour, which linearly decreases to 10 mm/hour after 40 minutes duration. As the event progresses, the infiltration rate further drops down linearly to attain a value of 4 mm/hour at $t = 100$ minutes and remains constant thereafter till the end of the storm event.

		The inlet leg length of the siphon to its summit is 2000 m. The difference in the water surface levels of the two reservoirs is 5 m. Assume the permissible minimum absolute pressure at the summit of siphon to be 2.5 m of water when running full. Given: friction factor $f = 0.02$ throughout, atmospheric pressure = 10.3 m of water, and acceleration due to gravity $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$.

A slope is to be made on this soil deposit in which the seepage occurs parallel to the slope up to the free surface.

		At each stage, the jacks are required to apply a force of 1875 kN to push the segment. The jacks will act against the rigid steel plate placed against the reaction arrangement. The blocks rest on a reinforced compaction natural ground at 37.5$^\circ$. The unit weight of PCC block is 24 kN/m$^3$. The properties of the natural ground are: $c = 17$ kN/m$^2$, $\phi = 25^\circ$ and $\gamma = 18$ kN/m$^3$. Assuming that the reaction arrangement has rough interface and has the same properties of that soil, the factor of safety \textit{(rounded off to 1 decimal place)} against shear failure is \rule{3cm}{0.15mm}.

	\item A square footing of 4 m side is placed at 1 m depth in a sand deposit. The dry unit weight ($\gamma$) of sand is 15 kN/m$^3$. This footing has an ultimate bearing capacity of 600 kPa.

For a factor of safety of 3.0 as per Terzaghi's theory, the safe bearing capacity (in kPa) of this footing would be \rule{3cm}{0.15mm}.
